# Data Science Projects: Text Cleaning and Formatting

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my skills in Python for Data Cleaning and String Manipulation. The goal was to take a raw, "messy" text file (containing symbols, extra spaces, and inconsistent casing) and transform it into a professional, readable paragraph format.

## Key Features
* **Symbol Removal:** Used `.replace()` to eliminate noise like `###`, `@@@`, and `!!!`.
* **Text Normalization:** Converted all text to lowercase for consistency and used `.strip()` to remove leading/trailing spaces.
* **Data Structuring:** Applied `.split()` and `.join()` to fix irregular spacing between words.
* **Professional Formatting:** Replaced shortcuts (e.g., 'gr8' to 'great', 'btw' to 'by the way') and capitalized the final output.
* **File Handling:** Successfully read data from `messy_blog.txt` and saved the final output into `clean_blog.txt`.

## Files in this Repository
1. **Untitled2.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and logic.
2. **messy_blog.txt**: The original uncleaned data with 16 pages of content.
3. **clean_blog.txt**: The final, cleaned, and well-formatted text file.

## Tools Used
* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* GitHub for Version Control
